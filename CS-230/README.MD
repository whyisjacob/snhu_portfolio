#Gaming Room
   - Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
     - Wanting to expand from their existing website, Chat Away is wanting a mobile app developed with a goal of increasing their customer base. In addition to increasing their base, they wanted to increase revenue. The goal for the development is for the app to live on both iPhone and Android app stores.
   - What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
     - I thought about the pro's and cons of the software and had to think about it from more than just a code perspective. Like what OS should this run on, security, storage management, etc. Think about things from a system perspective instead of a "one line of code onto the next"

   - What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
     - I had to keep myself in check when developing the app to be what I had written it down to be. I needed to be aware of scope creep and deliver what's promised.

   - If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
     - It's hard to say, each project that I work on is different so it'd require different things. Various items I wrote down on this document for this game won't really be applicable for a salon scheduling system, That being said, the base requirements would be the same. OS, Hardware, Deployment strategy, etc.

   - How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
     - Interpreting the needs of the user is important because they obviously have a problem that needs solving at a base level, but they also might not know how software works "under the hood" so they may not even know what they need from that perspective. What they think they need may not be what they actually need, but understanding that you also cannot be a jerk and pull the "my way or the highway" card. It's a collaborative effort between client and programmer.

   - How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
     - I think going this in depth in some applications would not be as required as it was in this case. For example, if you work for a company as a developer, they likely have a systematic method of using a specific operating platform, distributed system/network, security, and other applicable policies and procedures.
